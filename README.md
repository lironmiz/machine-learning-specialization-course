## 3. MACHINE LEARNING DEFINITION

![JustBasicStuffNormalGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230414731-e129d8a6-e1dd-4d7a-9057-051b4e137e85.gif)

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. It uses statistical techniques to enable computers to improve at a task over time, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications of machine learning include image and speech recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and predictive maintenance.

## 4. SUPERVISED LEARNING

![ThisIsAnImpressiveResultDerekMullerGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230476420-78789a70-70f7-4d58-a121-9254885c3f7b.gif)

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions by training on a labeled dataset. The labeled dataset consists of input data paired with corresponding output data, called labels or target variables. During training, the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting its internal parameters using various optimization techniques. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Supervised learning is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

## 5. REGRESSION

![LinearRegressionGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230476966-f6a148a8-2293-46f7-9002-aeb7e28953ab.gif)


Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values. The goal of regression is to build a model that can accurately predict the value of a dependent variable (also called the response variable) based on one or more independent variables (also called predictor variables or features). The most commonly used regression models include linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. Regression is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, engineering, and social sciences for predicting outcomes based on historical data.

## 6. CLASSIFICATION

![TheTruthIsTheTruthJulietteFairmontGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230478296-02fc6601-92f6-43f1-88a9-db44a03da90e.gif)

Classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting categorical values. The goal of classification is to build a model that can accurately classify input data into one of several predefined categories or classes. The input data is typically represented as a set of features, and the model learns to map the features to the corresponding class label based on labeled training data. The most commonly used classification algorithms include decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. Classification is widely used in various applications such as spam detection, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

## 7. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

![ThePatternHereIsClearSteveKornackiGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230479195-ced69b45-6e66-42aa-a335-b8de63d842da.gif)

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to identify patterns or relationships in input data without any labeled target variables. The algorithm is provided with a set of input data and must discover any underlying structure or patterns on its own. Unsupervised learning is often used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their features, while dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the number of features in the input data. Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual data points or patterns that do not fit the normal distribution of the input data. Unsupervised learning is widely used in fields such as finance, biology, and social network analysis.

## 8. LINEAR REGRESSION

![SecantLineConvergingToTangentLineAnimationGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230501458-ef15c631-16f7-471f-81d4-737523101c32.gif)

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted by "y") and one or more independent variables (usually denoted by "x"). The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, which means that a change in the independent variable(s) results in a proportional change in the dependent variable.

In other words, linear regression tries to find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the variables. This line can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable given the value(s) of the independent variable(s).

Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, biology, and engineering. It can be used for both simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable, and multiple linear regression, where there are several independent variables.

The method involves estimating the coefficients of the line of best fit using a technique called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The OLS method minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, which results in the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the variables.

## 9. COST FUNCTION

![GetBetterTrevorMcnealGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230512420-e8e7fa85-6dd7-4f93-9091-11ee9abdc920.gif)

The cost function, also known as the loss function or objective function, is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output for a given set of input data. Its purpose is to quantify how well a machine learning algorithm is performing and guide the optimization process of the model parameters to minimize the errors in the predictions. The choice of the cost function depends on the specific problem being solved, and there are different types of cost functions, such as mean squared error, cross-entropy, hinge loss, etc. The cost function plays a crucial role in training machine learning models and is typically optimized using techniques such as gradient descent.

## 10. GRADIENT DESCENT

![YogscastLydiaGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230588948-1c68af05-682f-48bb-85aa-6b4b4114e5d7.gif)

Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. It is a first-order optimization algorithm, meaning that it takes into account the first derivative of the cost function, which is also known as the gradient.

The basic idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively update the parameters of the model in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function. This means that the algorithm tries to find the minimum of the cost function by taking small steps in the direction of the steepest slope.

The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameter values and iteratively updates them until it reaches a minimum of the cost function. There are different variations of gradient descent, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent.

Gradient descent is widely used in various machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It is a powerful optimization algorithm that can converge to a minimum of the cost function quickly, especially when combined with other optimization techniques such as momentum, adaptive learning rates, and regularization.

## 11. MULTIPLE FEATURES

![MadroxMultipleManGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230588779-15bcc10b-8bde-4c01-b34c-76b075402b5e.gif)

multiple features refer to the variables or input data used to make predictions or classifications. These features are often represented as columns in a dataset and can be numerical, categorical, or textual in nature.

Feature selection and engineering are crucial steps in machine learning as they determine the quality of the model's predictions. Selecting the most relevant and informative features helps to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency.

Common techniques used in feature engineering include normalization, scaling, one-hot encoding, and dimensionality reduction. Additionally, feature selection methods such as correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination, and tree-based methods can be used to identify the most important features for a given problem.

## 12. FEATURE SCALING

![LookAtTheScaleHereDaveOlsonGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230591622-eed0aa7f-b500-4202-b973-4db846c2a8a3.gif)

Feature scaling is a technique used in machine learning to transform the range of input variables to a common scale. This is done to ensure that no variable has a disproportionate impact on the model due to its larger magnitude or range.

Common methods for feature scaling include normalization, which rescales the data to a range of 0 to 1, and standardization, which transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These techniques can be applied to both numerical and categorical variables.

Proper feature scaling can lead to faster and more accurate model training, particularly for algorithms that use distance-based measures, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines.

## 13. FEATURE ENGINEERING

![IWantToPlayAGameJigsawGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230595657-e84fe27f-42c7-42b7-a564-e92a686b307a.gif)

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, extracting, transforming, and creating features (input variables) from raw data in order to improve the performance of machine learning models.

Feature engineering can involve several techniques such as:

Feature extraction: This involves selecting relevant features from the original dataset and extracting useful information from them.

Feature transformation: This involves transforming the features in order to improve their quality or make them easier to use in a model. Examples of transformations include scaling, normalization, and one-hot encoding.

Feature creation: This involves creating new features from the original ones in order to capture important patterns or relationships in the data. Examples of feature creation include adding interaction terms, polynomial features, or feature combinations.

Feature engineering is an important step in the machine learning pipeline as it can greatly affect the performance of the models. It requires a combination of domain knowledge, creativity, and experimentation to determine the best set of features for a given problem.

## 14. SIGMOID FUNCTION

![ICantFunctionTheBlackHokageGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230645853-5b83a5b8-ca41-4db4-8d76-9540e287aff3.gif)

The sigmoid function is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1, which is often used in machine learning and artificial neural networks. Specifically, the sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve and is defined as:

f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)

where e is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. The sigmoid function is useful for tasks where we want to output a probability, as it maps any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230646021-feda48ed-2f47-4863-816d-dec2aae2fbaf.png)

## 15. LOGISTIC REGERSSION

![PrettyCoolAwesomeGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230646333-2ab30f9a-1ff3-4038-88c2-e5d6f98668c9.gif)

Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which involves predicting a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, true/false) based on one or more input variables (also known as features or predictors). It is a type of generalized linear model that uses the sigmoid function to transform the output of a linear equation into a probability value between 0 and 1.

In logistic regression, the goal is to find the best set of coefficients (weights) that minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes. This is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation or gradient descent. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data by feeding the input variables into the model and calculating the predicted probability of the binary outcome.

Logistic regression is a simple yet powerful method that is widely used in a variety of fields, including finance, healthcare, and marketing, among others. It is especially useful when the outcome variable is binary, and the input variables are continuous or categorical.

## 16. DECISION BOUNDARY

![ItsABigDecisionToMakeGaryGrahamGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230648329-2fb48fd8-55fa-40a9-be06-9156bf49d58c.gif)

A decision boundary is a concept in machine learning and data analysis that refers to the boundary or surface that separates different classes or groups in a dataset. In binary classification problems, the decision boundary is the line, curve, or surface that separates the data into two classes based on the values of the input variables.

The decision boundary is typically learned by a machine learning algorithm through a process of training on a labeled dataset. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unlabeled data by determining which side of the decision boundary the input data falls on.

The decision boundary is influenced by various factors, including the choice of algorithm, the input features, and the complexity of the model. In some cases, the decision boundary may be linear, while in other cases, it may be nonlinear or even highly complex.

Understanding the decision boundary is important in machine learning because it can help us interpret and visualize the results of a model, as well as identify areas where the model may be uncertain or where additional data or features may be needed to improve its accuracy.

## 17. OVERFITTING

![GoodButNotReallyRyanHigaGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230686012-a49d8c32-56c1-4b17-b0e3-703ca5ae1e86.gif)

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model is too complex and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning general patterns that can be applied to new, unseen data. This causes the model to perform very well on the training data but poorly on new data, which means that the model has not learned the underlying relationships in the data and has instead just memorized the noise. To prevent overfitting, techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, regularization, and data augmentation can be used.

## 18. ADDRESSING OVERFITTING

![StickergiantIllFixItGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230686640-850622bb-d38b-4bf6-b3c1-0b7683f6f4cf.gif)

ddressing overfitting in machine learning is crucial for building models that generalize well to new, unseen data. Some of the techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting include:

Cross-validation: This involves splitting the data into multiple sets and training the model on each set to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

Early stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process once the model's performance on a validation set stops improving.

Regularization: This technique involves adding a penalty term to the model's loss function to prevent it from becoming too complex and overfitting the data.

Data augmentation: This involves generating additional training data by applying transformations to the existing data.

By applying these techniques, one can build models that are less likely to overfit the training data and perform well on new, unseen data.

## 20. FORWARD PROPAGATION

![IHavePredictedItFamilyFeudCanadaGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231021146-3e3bb4a3-6579-4102-878a-b8b737d2e8e1.gif)

Forward propagation is the process by which a neural network calculates its output based on the input data. During forward propagation, the input data is passed through the layers of the network, and each neuron in each layer performs a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias term, and applies an activation function to produce an output. The output from each neuron in one layer serves as input to the next layer, until the final layer produces the network's output.

The weights and biases in the network are learned during training, using an optimization algorithm that adjusts them to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual output. The optimization algorithm typically involves backpropagation, in which the error between the predicted and actual output is propagated backward through the network to adjust the weights and biases.

Overall, forward propagation is a key step in the functioning of a neural network, as it allows the network to make predictions based on input data, and the accuracy of those predictions depends on the quality of the weights and biases learned during training.

## 28. CONVOLUTIONAL LAYER

![ThisIsCertainlyAnUpgradeRealHousewivesOfNewYorkGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231286015-90228f0d-7c1b-4467-aaec-d73d3663f688.gif)

A convolutional layer is a type of layer in a neural network that performs convolution operations on input data. It is commonly used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and audio processing.

The convolutional layer consists of a set of learnable filters that are convolved with the input data to produce a set of feature maps. The filters are typically small and are slid over the input data to extract local patterns or features. Each filter produces a feature map that represents the response of that filter at every location in the input.

The convolutional layer has several advantages over traditional fully connected layers. It reduces the number of parameters in the network, allowing it to scale to larger inputs and more complex tasks. It also exploits spatial relationships in the input data, making it well-suited for tasks such as image recognition.

Convolutional layers can be stacked together to create deep convolutional neural networks, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks. They are often combined with other types of layers such as pooling layers, activation layers, and normalization layers to create a complete network architecture.

Overall, convolutional layers are an important component of modern neural networks and have revolutionized the field of computer vision. They have enabled the development of sophisticated models that can extract meaningful features from raw input data, leading to breakthroughs in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification.

## 30. DATA AUGMENTATION

![ItsTimeToMakeAChangeRobotusGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231294335-545f9259-5cc8-4028-8532-9adbd198f615.gif)

Data augmentation is the process of artificially creating new variations of existing data by applying various transformations such as flipping, rotating, scaling, cropping, or adding noise. The goal of data augmentation is to increase the size and diversity of a training dataset, which can help improve the accuracy and generalization of machine learning models. Data augmentation is commonly used in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, where the availability of large and diverse datasets is often limited. By generating new data from existing samples, data augmentation can help overcome the problem of overfitting and improve the robustness and reliability of machine learning models.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231294363-313f0878-2a66-4bdf-a4c6-c75719a6dc4b.png)

## 31. PRECISION AND RECALL

![ItsKindOfImportantJordanTheakerGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231296643-c098daeb-220f-4641-a80c-d651a133659a.gif)

Precision and recall are two commonly used performance metrics in machine learning evaluation.

Precision is a measure of the accuracy of positive predictions made by a model. It is the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the total number of positive (TP + false positive, FP) predictions. A high precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate and is good at correctly identifying positive instances.

Recall, on the other hand, is a measure of the completeness of positive predictions made by a model. It is the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the total number of actual positive (TP + false negative, FN) instances. A high recall indicates that the model has a low false negative rate and is good at identifying all positive instances.

In summary, precision measures how well a model predicts positive instances, while recall measures how well a model captures all positive instances. The choice of which metric to prioritize depends on the specific problem and the trade-off between precision and recall that is acceptable for the application.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231296736-7912e925-4f06-43b7-b3f3-3259aa20fade.png)

## 32. F1 SCORE

![LetsSeeWhoGotTheBetterScoreAustinEvansGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231300833-4276ac7c-2cb6-47a5-899f-10c066e1dc46.gif)

The F1 score is a commonly used performance metric in machine learning that combines precision and recall into a single value. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, with a value ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the best possible performance.

The F1 score is calculated as 2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall). It is a useful metric when both precision and recall are important, and an equally balanced trade-off is desired between the two. A high F1 score indicates that the model has a good balance between precision and recall, and is performing well in identifying all relevant instances while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

In summary, the F1 score is a composite metric that measures the overall effectiveness of a model by considering both precision and recall, and is a useful metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models.

## 33. DECISION TREE

![NewRevealAWholeNewWorldGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231458558-8d454ddc-a2fb-4a93-a3ee-a86e4db8082f.gif)

A decision tree is a popular model in machine learning that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. The model consists of a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a test on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a numerical value.

To create a decision tree, the algorithm recursively splits the data based on the feature that provides the most information gain until it reaches a stopping criterion, such as a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum depth of the tree.

Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize, but they can suffer from overfitting if not properly tuned or regularized. Various ensemble methods, such as random forests and gradient boosting, can be used to improve the performance and robustness of decision trees.

## 34. INFORMATION GAIN

![NoPainNoGainWorkoutGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231463491-ab472313-d613-4eb1-b018-330750dc4a3a.gif)

Information gain is a criterion used in decision trees to determine the best split at each node of the tree. The basic idea is to choose the feature that provides the most information about the target variable.

Information gain is calculated as the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the weighted average impurity of the child nodes after the split. Impurity is a measure of how mixed the classes are in a set of samples. Common impurity measures include entropy, Gini impurity, and classification error.

The feature with the highest information gain is selected for the split, and the process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met. The stopping criterion could be a minimum number of samples per leaf or a maximum depth of the tree.

Information gain is a popular criterion for decision trees, but it has some limitations. For example, it tends to favor features with many possible values and can be biased towards features with a large number of categories. Other criteria, such as gain ratio and chi-square, can be used to address these issues.

## 35. TREE ENSEMBLE

![DancingTreeGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231473483-034a57b8-f77a-4cdd-9260-60a1d01a76c4.gif)

Tree ensembles are machine learning models that combine multiple decision trees to improve the performance and robustness of the individual trees. The two most popular tree ensembles are random forests and gradient boosting.

Random forests are a type of ensemble learning that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through voting. Each tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of the features, which helps to reduce overfitting and increase diversity in the ensemble.

Gradient boosting is a method that iteratively adds decision trees to the model, with each tree trained to correct the errors of the previous tree. Gradient boosting can be used for both regression and classification tasks and is often used with decision trees as the base estimator.

Both random forests and gradient boosting are powerful machine learning models that can achieve high accuracy on a wide range of tasks. They are also relatively easy to use and require little hyperparameter tuning. However, they can be computationally expensive and may not be the best choice for very large datasets or real-time applications.

## 36. SAMPLING WITH REPLACEMENT

![NumbersDontLieStatisticsGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231480071-c07cef40-6b9c-4dae-a9f2-f6daeb53aba5.gif)

Sampling with replacement is a statistical method that involves randomly selecting data points from a dataset and allowing the same data point to be selected multiple times. This means that each selected data point has an equal probability of being chosen for each selection.

Sampling with replacement is commonly used in bootstrap methods, which involve repeatedly resampling the data with replacement to estimate the variability of a statistical model or estimate. By resampling the data, bootstrap methods can estimate the distribution of a statistic, such as the mean or standard deviation, without assuming a specific probability distribution.

Sampling with replacement can also be used in machine learning algorithms, such as bagging, which involves building multiple models on random subsets of the training data and combining their predictions through voting or averaging. By using sampling with replacement, bagging can reduce overfitting and increase the diversity of the models in the ensemble.

Overall, sampling with replacement is a useful statistical method for estimating uncertainty and improving the performance of machine learning models.

## 37. RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM

![RandomSnlGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231481948-94503a15-5146-4c78-b7c0-e353479d33fd.gif)

Random forest is a popular ensemble learning algorithm in machine learning that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It works by training a large number of decision trees on random subsets of the training data and features, and then combining their predictions through voting or averaging.

Random forest can be used for both classification and regression tasks, and it has several advantages over a single decision tree. Random forest is less prone to overfitting than a single decision tree, and it can handle a large number of input features without overfitting. It also provides feature importance scores that can be used for feature selection and interpretation.

The main steps of the random forest algorithm are:

Randomly select a subset of the training data with replacement.
Randomly select a subset of the input features.
Build a decision tree on the selected data and features.
Repeat steps 1-3 to build a forest of decision trees.
Predict the class label or numerical value by aggregating the predictions of the decision trees in the forest, such as by voting or averaging.
Random forest can be tuned by adjusting hyperparameters such as the number of trees in the forest, the depth of each tree, and the number of features selected for each tree. It is a powerful and versatile algorithm that has been used in many applications, such as image classification, bioinformatics, and financial modeling.

## 38. XGBOOST

![ThanksBoostGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231483323-e76c214e-efc7-4a86-ac8c-0096f0b574a4.gif)

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and popular gradient boosting algorithm used in machine learning for both regression and classification tasks. It is an extension of the gradient boosting algorithm that optimizes the objective function by using second-order derivatives of the loss function.

XGBoost works by iteratively adding decision trees to the model, with each tree trained to correct the errors of the previous tree. XGBoost uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

The key features of XGBoost are its speed, scalability, and performance. It is designed to handle large datasets and can handle missing values and sparse data. It also includes regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, to prevent overfitting.

XGBoost has become one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms and has won several competitions on Kaggle and other data science platforms. It has been used in various applications, such as fraud detection, stock prediction, and natural language processing.

Clustering is a technique in machine learning and data analysis that involves grouping together similar data points based on their features or attributes. The goal of clustering is to find patterns or structure in a dataset that may not be immediately obvious, and to identify groups or clusters of data points that share similar characteristics.

There are several different types of clustering algorithms, including hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and density-based clustering. Each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and is suited to different types of data and clustering tasks.

Clustering has a wide range of applications in fields such as marketing, biology, social network analysis, and image segmentation, among others. It is often used to discover patterns or trends in large datasets, to identify groups of similar customers or users, or to classify data points into different categories.

## 41. GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION

![DiracDistributionDeDiracGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/231537852-6609fdd3-dd4b-4c11-86a1-1386d1d50700.gif)

The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a probability distribution that is commonly used in statistics and data analysis. It is a bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around its mean value, with most of the data falling within one standard deviation of the mean. The Gaussian distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean and the standard deviation. The mean represents the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the spread of the data. Many natural phenomena, such as heights, weights, and IQ scores, follow a Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian distribution has many applications in science, engineering, finance, and other fields.
