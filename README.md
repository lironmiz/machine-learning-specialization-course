## 3. MACHINE LEARNING DEFINITION

![JustBasicStuffNormalGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230414731-e129d8a6-e1dd-4d7a-9057-051b4e137e85.gif)

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. It uses statistical techniques to enable computers to improve at a task over time, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The main types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Applications of machine learning include image and speech recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection, recommendation systems, healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and predictive maintenance.

## 4. SUPERVISED LEARNING

![ThisIsAnImpressiveResultDerekMullerGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230476420-78789a70-70f7-4d58-a121-9254885c3f7b.gif)

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which an algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions by training on a labeled dataset. The labeled dataset consists of input data paired with corresponding output data, called labels or target variables. During training, the algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by adjusting its internal parameters using various optimization techniques. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Supervised learning is used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.

## 5. REGRESSION

Regression is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values. The goal of regression is to build a model that can accurately predict the value of a dependent variable (also called the response variable) based on one or more independent variables (also called predictor variables or features). The most commonly used regression models include linear regression, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. Regression is widely used in various fields such as finance, economics, engineering, and social sciences for predicting outcomes based on historical data.

## 6. CLASSIFICATION

Classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm used for predicting categorical values. The goal of classification is to build a model that can accurately classify input data into one of several predefined categories or classes. The input data is typically represented as a set of features, and the model learns to map the features to the corresponding class label based on labeled training data. The most commonly used classification algorithms include decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks. Classification is widely used in various applications such as spam detection, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition.

## 7. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

![ThePatternHereIsClearSteveKornackiGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230479195-ced69b45-6e66-42aa-a335-b8de63d842da.gif)

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to identify patterns or relationships in input data without any labeled target variables. The algorithm is provided with a set of input data and must discover any underlying structure or patterns on its own. Unsupervised learning is often used for tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their features, while dimensionality reduction techniques aim to reduce the number of features in the input data. Anomaly detection algorithms identify unusual data points or patterns that do not fit the normal distribution of the input data. Unsupervised learning is widely used in fields such as finance, biology, and social network analysis.

## 8. LINEAR REGRESSION

![SecantLineConvergingToTangentLineAnimationGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230501458-ef15c631-16f7-471f-81d4-737523101c32.gif)

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted by "y") and one or more independent variables (usually denoted by "x"). The relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear, which means that a change in the independent variable(s) results in a proportional change in the dependent variable.

In other words, linear regression tries to find the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the variables. This line can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable given the value(s) of the independent variable(s).

Linear regression is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, biology, and engineering. It can be used for both simple linear regression, where there is only one independent variable, and multiple linear regression, where there are several independent variables.

The method involves estimating the coefficients of the line of best fit using a technique called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). The OLS method minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, which results in the line of best fit that describes the relationship between the variables.

## 9. COST FUNCTION

![GetBetterTrevorMcnealGIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91504420/230512420-e8e7fa85-6dd7-4f93-9091-11ee9abdc920.gif)

The cost function, also known as the loss function or objective function, is a mathematical function that measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output for a given set of input data. Its purpose is to quantify how well a machine learning algorithm is performing and guide the optimization process of the model parameters to minimize the errors in the predictions. The choice of the cost function depends on the specific problem being solved, and there are different types of cost functions, such as mean squared error, cross-entropy, hinge loss, etc. The cost function plays a crucial role in training machine learning models and is typically optimized using techniques such as gradient descent.

## 10. GRADIENT DESCENT



Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function of a machine learning model. It is a first-order optimization algorithm, meaning that it takes into account the first derivative of the cost function, which is also known as the gradient.

The basic idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively update the parameters of the model in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function. This means that the algorithm tries to find the minimum of the cost function by taking small steps in the direction of the steepest slope.

The algorithm starts with an initial set of parameter values and iteratively updates them until it reaches a minimum of the cost function. There are different variations of gradient descent, including batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent.

Gradient descent is widely used in various machine learning models, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. It is a powerful optimization algorithm that can converge to a minimum of the cost function quickly, especially when combined with other optimization techniques such as momentum, adaptive learning rates, and regularization.
